# Udagram Image Filtering Microservice

Udagram is a simple cloud application developed alongside the Udacity Cloud Engineering Nanodegree. It allows users to process photos using an image filtering microservice.

## Tasks

### Setup Node Environment

You'll need to create a new node server. Open a new terminal within the project directory and run:

1. clone the repo https://github.com/rogerndutiye/aws-image-filter.git
1. Initialize a new project: `npm i`
2. run the development server with `npm run dev

### Deploying the aplication system

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to your Express.js TypeScript project directory. Run the following command to initialize a new Elastic Beanstalk environment: `eb init` a new application and `eb create` a new environment to deploy your image-filter service! Don't forget you can use `eb deploy` to push changes
